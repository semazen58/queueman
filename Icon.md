# CLosed #
Alexis' nifty red icon wins out with a minor adjustment.

# Introduction #

I am not a graphic designer ( I know you are all shocked...) luckily I am getting some help!

## New Icon Design ##
Alexis Gonzalez recently suggested this new icon for QueueMan


<img src='http://images.webbmaster.org/QueueMan/redQueueMan_icon.png' width='80' />


And I have to admit I like it.

## Old Icon Design ##
You can see it while using QueueMan, and in the upper left of this screen.
