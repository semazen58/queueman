## My Stance ##
**Queueman's Logo, Name, and screens were all approved previously by Netflix's** (then) app review process.

I have provided Netflix, via the complaintent, with the previous record of approval seeking clarification -- but have no intentions to fight their request.  Queueman was built in a time when no other solutions existed.  I worked closely with many supportive people from Netflix and the developer community in their now defunct dev forums.

Since that time Netflix has released their own application, and I can respect their reasons (brand confusion, etc) to not have other Netflix application in the market. I disagree with their approach (My email -is- was published alongside the application in Google Play).

The source code remains free and open (and in use in some other Netflix Queue apps on the market).

**Thank you to the faithful users and supporters.**
