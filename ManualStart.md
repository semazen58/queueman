# Getting Started #

Netflix requires that QueueMan get your blessing before interacting with your account.

To complete this choir, you will be connected to Netflix when you start QueueMan for the first time.

**Because the first time operation is rather internet dependent it is recommended you do this over Wi-Fi or a solid 3G connection.**

You will enter your account info **(directly to Netflix, and never seen by our application)** and when confirmed choose "Yes, Link this Account"

Netflix will then call our application back giving us a secret key that allows us to access your account. It will only work for our application, and you can revoke it through Netflix at any time.
