=Getting Started=

Netflix requires that !QueueMan get your blessing before interacting with your account.

To complete this choir, you will be connected to Netflix when you start !QueueMan for the first time.

*Because the first time operation is rather internet dependent it is recommended you do this over Wi-Fi or a solid 3G connection.*

You will enter your account info *(directly to Netflix, and never seen by our application)* and when confirmed choose "Yes, Link this Account" 

Netflix will then call our application back giving us a secret key that allows us to access your account. It will only work for our application, and you can revoke it through Netflix at any time.
